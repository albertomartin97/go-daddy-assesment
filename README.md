-- Getting started --

To run the project, npm and Node.js must be installed in your PC.

Please open the go-daddy folder in a terminal and run inside the folder the "npm start" command.

This should run the project in a localhost on your browser.


-- Additional information --

The first thing I should mention is that this is my first time using React. 
I am experienced developing web application but with the Angular framework.

For this project, as I did not know much about the architecture and the more 
complex functionalities I tried to keep it simple. I designed two layouts in the
same page that change according to a boolean declared in the class. By doing this,
I avoided the need of implementing more components and a routing system. 

The look of the page was designed to be simple and clean. The first elements we see
are the title of the app followed by a list of divs containing the different repositories
titles. When we click on one of them we access to the details of that repo, where we can
see some relevant information about it. On the top left corner there is an icon of an arrow
that will allow us to go back to the main page.

Thank you for you time!
